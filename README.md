I like antkeeping and coding but I am really not a fan of sour candies. 

# Projects 
- I was working on study-notes with python using appjar and it can be checked here https://github.com/joshua-park-tech/study-notes
- Currently building Animal-Drum with kivy https://github.com/joshua-park-tech/animal_drum
- I am a part of the GAN (global ant nursery) project
